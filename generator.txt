Generator Function in Python
A generator function is a special type of function that returns an iterator object. Instead of using return to send back a single value, generator functions use yield to produce a series of results over time. This allows the function to generate values and pause its execution after each yield, maintaining its state between iterations.
def fun(max):
    cnt = 1
    while cnt <= max:
        yield cnt
        cnt += 1

ctr = fun(5)
for n in ctr:
    print(n)
output-
1
2
3
4
5
Explanation: This generator function fun yields numbers from 1 up to a specified max. Each call to next() on the generator object resumes execution right after the yield statement, where it last left off.
