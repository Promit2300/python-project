Floating point numbers are used to represent noninteger fractional numbers and are used in most engineering and technical calculations, for example, 3.256, 2.1, and 0.0036. The most commonly used floating point standard is the IEEE standard.

VARIABLE AND ASSIGNMENT:
A variable is a string of characters and numbers associated with a piece of information.

The line x=1 takes the known value, 1, and assigns that value to the variable with name “x”.
