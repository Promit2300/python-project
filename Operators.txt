Arithmetic Operators-
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y
%	Modulus(ভাগশেষ)	x % y	eg-
        x = 89
        y = 6

        print(x % y)	|OUTPUT- 5

**	Exponentiation	x ** y	eg-
        x = 2
	y = 5

	print(x ** y) #same as 2*2*2*2*2	|OUTPUT- 32	

//	Floor division	x // y eg-
	x = 15
	y = 2

	print(x // y)	|OUTPUT- 7

	#the floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number

LOGICAL OPERATORS-
==	Equal	x == y	eg-
	x = 5
	y = 3

	print(x == y)	|OUTPUT- False

# returns False because 5 is not equal to 3
!=	Not equal	x != y	eg-
	x = 5
	y = 3

	print(x != y)	|OUTPUT- True

# returns True because 5 is not equal to 3
>	Greater than	x > y	
	x = 5
	y = 3

	print(x > y)	|OUTPUT- True

# returns True because 5 is greater than 3
<	Less than	x < y
	x = 5
	y = 3

	print(x < y)	|OUTPUT- False

# returns False because 5 is not less than 3
	
	>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
	x = 5
	y = 3

	print(x >= y)	|OUTPUT- True

# returns True because five is greater, or equal, to 3
	<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y	
	x = 5
	y = 3

	print(x <= y)	|OUTPUT- False

# returns False because 5 is neither less than or equal to 3
Logical Operators-
and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10 eg-
	x = 5

	print(x > 3 and x < 10)	|OUTPUT- True

# returns True because 5 is greater than 3 AND 5 is less than 10	
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	eg=
	x = 5

	print(x > 3 or x < 4) |OUTPUT- True

# returns True because one of the conditions are true (5 is greater than 3, but 5 is not less than 4)
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)	eg-
	x = 5

	print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))	|	OUTPUT- False

# returns False because not is used to reverse the result
